    ```
    
3.- Restart your computer when prompted.

    ![Windows Store Ubuntu]()
    
5.- Select _Get_
    ![Selecting 'Get' from the MS Store Ubuntu result]()

    ![Open power shell in Windows]()

Voil√†! You have a Linux Subsystem on Windows üëçüèº

## Things to keep in mind
- Everytime we mention _Command Line_ it refers to the `bash` enabled PowerShell.
    ![Not PowerShell]()
    ![Yes bash enabled PowerShell]()

- **Do not** open the Ubuntu shell (click on the Ubuntu icon) as it will open a Command Line located in a different folder than your current environment.
